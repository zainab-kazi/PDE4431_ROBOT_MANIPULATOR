# PDE4431_ROBOT_MANIPULATOR
INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the simulation of the EPSON VT6 robot manipulator using RoboDK and Python. The task involves designing and simulating a robot work cell to perform object manipulation tasks, including picking, filling, and placing. The simulation replicates the robot’s real-world operations, showcasing precision and efficiency in industrial automation.
The work cell consists of three main areas:
•	Feed Frame: Where the robot picks up the object (ice cream cone).
•	Filling Station: The robot performs filling operations through circular motions.
•	Outlet Frame: The filled object is placed in the designated slot.
